# QSExtension_SetObjectState

This Qlik Sense Extension allows you to assign any object to any state, be it an alternate state or back to the main state.

This extension is for developers to assign a given Qlik Sense object to any state, be it an Alternate 
State or back to the main Selection State. It complements the extension "alternate states for Qlik Sense" 
by ssimeonov. 

Once the objects are assigned, you can remove the extension again from the sheet as the settings are saved 
with the app.
