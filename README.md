# QSExtension_SetObjectState

This Qlik Sense Extension allows you to assign any object to any state, be it an alternate state or back to the main state.

This extension is for developers to assign a given Qlik Sense object to any state, be it an Alternate 
State or back to the main Selection State. This version 2 is a complete stand-alone solution, no dependencies 
on other extensions.

* You can <b>create and remove</b> any state on app level.
* You can pick any object by clicking on a new pop-up menu
* You can then assign the choosen object to a new state.

Once the objects are assigned, you can remove the extension again from the sheet as the settings are saved 
with the app.
